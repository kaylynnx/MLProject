# Abstract

The problem that our algorithm is attempting to address is predicting what a person is doing based on a trace of movements using sensors. This is also known as Human Activity Recognition. The approach to our algorithm is to load a data set containing human activity such as walking, sitting, and laying down. Then, our method is to model activities from data across subjects. The data can be pre-segmented per activity and a we can train the model on the entire data for each activity. To model our successes, we will measure the accuracy of our algorithm using a confusion matrix.
