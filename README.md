# MLProject



## Planned Deliverables
We are planning on submitting one python file with all of our code and functions, as well as a Jupyter notebook to import our data and perform our analysis and visualizations. Since this data was already used to perform an analysis, we will be performing a literature review of those studies./
**Full Success:** We will be performing an exploratory analysis along with visualizations of a variety of variables such as total acceleration, body acceleration, and body gyroscope in all the types of activies across time. We will then use that knowledge to use a few predictive models on the data to predict the activity type based on the value of the variables. We will also submit a well-documented and clean code base.
**Partial Success:** Similarly to above, we will be performing an exploratory analysis along with visualizations of a variety of variables such as total acceleration, body acceleration, and body gyroscope in all the types of activies across time, however we will then only use one predictive models on the data. We will also submit a well-documented and clean code base.


## Resources Required
We will be using the University of California Irvine's [Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions) to complete this project.


## What You Will Learn
**Zayn:**
I will ensure that our group will meet often to discuss the progress on the project and make sure that we are all on the same page. I will also make sure that we are all communicating with each other. I will also make sure that we are all submitting our milestones on time and that we are all working on the project. I am going to reinforce my knowledge on the pandas, sklearn, and matplotlibs libraries, as well as any other necessary libraries. At the end, I will revise the project report in response to feedback.

## Risk Statement
This data was already studied, and so a potential risk for our project would be us getting delayed in finding an original approach to analyse the data. Another risk is not having enough time to achieve all that we want to do.
